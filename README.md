2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
It's a totally new language to me. In school, I haven't taken web development class before. However, I think except for html or css, javascript is similiar to language I have learned (C++ and Python). HTML and CSS are new to me. I took some time to read tutorial on w3school, but it was not quite difficult the format language. Also, javascript as a programming language is using a similiar syntax as C++.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
